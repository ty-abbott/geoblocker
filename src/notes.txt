Essentially we will have one while loop, it is collecting the IP addresses and sending them to the API server. It is going to be a constant websocket connection. When there is a stop command this connection will get that command and then have the gathering GRACEFULLY stop. It will return to the main thread and do whatever is necessary, which I believe will mostly just be ending the process
