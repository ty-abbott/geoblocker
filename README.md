This is a tool that I am building in python that will see traffic that is hitting against a linux server and then block traffic based on location.


### UPDATES 

- I think that I want to completely change up the scope of this project. It is not a terrible idea but also it is kind of pointless to block IPs like this. There will be lots of IPs added and it wont be efficient. With IP recycling it also posses the problem of later blocking by legitimate traffic. - I think I still want to go forward with this project from a learning perspective. I want to be able to run the code that analyzes the network traffic across a network interface in C. Or better yet probably rust. I dont know, this is really for my own learning and I want to get better at understanding C... so that could be the move. So essentially this is creating a packet capture tool and maybe I add some fun features in like ip lookup and information on the IPs via virustotal or something else.
